Description OF Project:-
<br>
The Prescription chain database is designed to manage information related to the prescription process. It includes tables for doctors, patients, drugs, pharmacies, and contracts between pharmaceutical companies and pharmacies. Key aspects of the system include storing doctor and patient information, tracking prescriptions issued by doctors, managing drug
inventories at pharmacies, and maintaining contractual agreements. The design ensures data consistency through the use of foreign key constraints, linking entities such as doctors, patients, and drugs.
